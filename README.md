Custom card for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to directly control BLE light bulbs through Web Bluetooth.

Bluetooth interaction can be a real pain in HASS, and sometime you just need to change the color of your cheap light bulbs (Triones, MagicBlue, ...). This custom card comes to the rescue adding a bare-minimum functionality to be able to turn on, off, and change the color.

# Installation
You can install the custom card using [HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz), or just add the ble-bulb-card.js file to your config/www/ folder in HASS.

# Configuration
Add a card with the following configuration to any of your Lovelace views.
```yaml
type: 'custom:ble-bulb-card'
bulb-types:
  - triones
  - magicblue
```
| option | value |
|--|--|
| type | REQUIRED a list of BLE bulbs to search for. |

Supported values
- triones
- magicblue

# Usage
- After adding the card, just click on the ðŸ”— link icon: this will open the Bluetooth device selection (it will show only the bulb types that you chose in the configuration).

- Choose one of the devices and click on "pair"; wait a bit while the connection is established (this may fail, see [Known issues](#known-issues)).

- As connected, the dot in the middle of the card will become green (ðŸŸ¢): you can then use the color selector on the right to change.

To disconnect click on the unlink icon, or just refresh the page.

# Supported devices
At the current moment only Triones (Flyidea/HappyLighting) and MagicBlue bulbs are supported .

# Known issues
Please be aware that Web Bluetooth is still an experimental technology and may not work as expected.
For instance, from my experience with Triones bulbs I noticed that several times the bulb just doesn't connect, while some others it's required to connect twice to actually be able to interact with the bulb.
